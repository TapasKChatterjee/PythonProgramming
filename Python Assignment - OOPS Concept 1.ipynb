    "The four fundamental principles or pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It restricts access to some of the object's components, preventing direct modification or access and enforcing the use of getter and setter methods for controlled access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstract classes and interfaces in OOP provide a blueprint for other classes and define a set of methods without implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (derived or child class) inherits properties and behaviors from another class (base or parent class). It promotes code reusability by allowing a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class and extend or override them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to be used for entities of different types. Polymorphism in OOP takes different forms: method overriding (providing a specific implementation of a method in a subclass), and method overloading (having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "These four principles form the foundation of object-oriented programming and guide the design, implementation, and interaction of objects in a system, promoting code organization, modularity, and flexibility."
